h1. MD Eexcerpt

To make decent excerpts, I needed something that stripped out all tags first and then limited the remaining words, all in one fell swoop, so I combined those functions into one plugin. Rick Ellis originally wrote Word Limit, then Vik Rubenfeld modified that into Word Limit Plus. I took Vik's modification and added some HTML stripping for your eexcerpting pleasure.

For some background on this plugin, you can review these threads:
